README:


Many of the examples contained in this folder were generated using fuzzylite's
CppExporter, FisImporter/FisExporter, and FclImporter/FclExporter. However, 
some of the original examples come from GNU Octave's fuzzy-logic-toolbox package
and from Matlab's fuzzy logic toolbox. Specifically, the examples from such 
third-parties are:

GNU Octave: (original files)
investment_portfolio.fis 
mamdani_tip_calculator.fis

Matlab: (original files)
mam21.fis
mam22.fis
shower.fis
tipper.fis
